"""Builds the launcher icon in MeeGo's own icon shape.

Harmattan launcher icons are not free-form: every stock icon is cut to the
same rounded-square "squircle", and an icon that keeps its own outline -- a
plain square, as the Sailfish one is -- reads as foreign among them on the
home screen. The silhouette is therefore taken literally from a stock icon's
alpha channel rather than approximated: the icons under
/usr/share/themes/blanco/meegotouch/icons/icon-l-*.png all carry it, pixel
for pixel, and one of them is kept here beside the script as mask-icon-l.png.

The artwork itself is SeaPrint's own, straight from the Sailfish icon -- only
its outline changes. Everything is done at 4x and scaled down at the end;
the curve aliases badly if it is drawn at 80 px.
